Recursion:
- find the base case, first case, then the case for n in relation to n-1
- all recursion can be done interatvely 
- recursion bad for space in comparison to iteration

Tail Recursion:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33923/what-is-tail-recursion
- computing the recursive output inside the function before the return call
- means that the same space in the stack is used for the function
- instead of a new item in the stack for every call
